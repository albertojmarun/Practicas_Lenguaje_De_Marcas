                    <h2> Apple Event (November 10)</h2>
                    <img src="../images/apple_event.png" alt="Apple Event Picture">
                    <p> The company on Monday announced another launch event<i> — its third in recent months — </i> scheduled for November 10. An invite sent to reporters was simply titled "One More Thing," a line Apple often deploys at the end of big events to debut a surprise product. </p>
                    <p> The invitation did not give any hints about what Apple (AAPL) plans to reveal, but there is one product the company has previously teased but hasn't yet released. </p>
                    <p> At its Worldwide Developer Conference in June, Apple announced it would soon start using its own silicon chips in its Mac computer lineup, switching away from the ones made by Intel that the devices have used for years. Apple said the first Macs with the new chips would begin rolling out by the end of this year. </p>

                    <h2> Walmart Robots </h2>
                    <img src="../images/walmart.jpg" alt="Walmart_shop">
                    <p> There’s an old saying that asks, “Why buy the cow if you can get the milk for free?” But lately, in the case of Walmart, it’s more a case of “Why buy the robot if you can get some guy to do it for less?” </p>
                    <p> This in a week that has seen news reports that the world’s largest retailer has terminated its contract — and a 3-year-old automated shelf-stocking experiment — with San Francisco’s Bossa Nova Robotics, having found that existing “human” employees were able to do the same work just as well. </p>
                    <p> To say Walmart’s robotic reversal is significant would be an understatement, given its sheer size and clout, as well as the fact that as recently as January the company had planned to triple its robotic fleet and release the autonomous units in 1,000 of its 4,700 stores. </p>

                    <p> The drone light shows are powered by multiple LED-lit drones. </p>
                    <p> They swirl through the sky in a choregraphed dance at the control of a computer and a human "pilot," and they're pre-programmed to show specific words, colors and images. The drones are usually quadcopters -- a drone with four rotors and often complement firework displays </p>
                    <p> But the power isn't in the drones; it's packed inside the software. </p>
                    <p> The number of drones used for a show can range anywhere from 50 to thousands, with shows lasting roughly 5 to 15 minutes depending on the drones' weight and battery capacity. And the costs for a show can be pretty pricey. </p>

                    <h2> Tesla is near to Bankrupt! </h2>
                    <img src="../images/elon_musk_tesla.jpg" alt="ElonMusk_near_to_Bankrupt">
                    <p> Tesla has become the most valuable and (by some measures) the most profitable automaker in the world, But a short while ago it nearly toppled into bankruptcy. </p>
                    <p> CEO Elon Musk tweeted this week that the company was within a month of filing for bankruptcy when it was struggling to bring its best-selling vehicle, the Model 3 sedan, to market. </p>
                    <p> "Closest we got was about a month," he said when asked via Twitter how close Tesla got to bankruptcy. "The Model 3 ramp was extreme stress & pain for a long time — from mid 2017 to mid 2019. Production & logistics hell." </p>
                    <p> Tesla was in a serious cash crunch as losses mounted and it struggled to hit various production targets for the Model 3. But Musk hadn't previously disclosed the company was close to filing for bankruptcy -- although he did joke about a bankruptcy filing in a separate tweet on April Fool's Day in 2018. </p>
